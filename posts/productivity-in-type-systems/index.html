productivity. I think this depends on your definition of productivity. I can
think of two:</p><ol><li>To write the smallest amount of code in the shortest amount of time</li><li>To consistently produce working and bug-free code in such a way that it
scales as the codebase and team grow over time.</li></ol><p>The presence of a type system could certainly hurt productivity in the first
case, because languages with type systems often need to be supported by
compilers and build tools. I find this type of productivity to be useful when
I&rsquo;m writing small scripts that are run only a handful of times and/or rarely
change.</p><p>Type systems are invaluable in the second case because they offer benefits
that support those dimensions of scaling:</p><ol><li>They provide a framework within which you can precisely express your ideas.
My favorite example is <em>algebraic data types</em> or <em>enums</em>, which are a
fundamental construct in data modeling, but are absent in most mainstream
languages.</li><li>They guarantee the absence of certain errors in a well-typed program,
particularly large programs which are rapidly changing.</li><li>Typing information serves as documentation and as a static approximation
for how a program behaves, so it is easier to infer intent from code long
after it is written.</li></ol></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright Â© 2020 Raas Ahsan</footer></body></html>
